Required elements used:

1. JavaScript (w/ prototypical objects)
  - Almost every front-end scripting file uses JavaScript objects with
    custom prototyping. (see contents of ./static/scripts/)
  - Object inheritence is also used. 
     - For example, see ./static/scripts/EditorActions.js, which 
       has several subclassed objects for different actions on the 
       undo/redo action stack

2. Canvas
  - The playing area, as well as the editing area are almost entirely
    Canvas-based. 
  - We also use Canvas svg-style shadowing on lines 524-527 of
    ./static/scripts/EditorManager.js

3. HTML
  - 

4. CSS
  - Multiple techniques used, such as:
    - resets (line 9, ./static/index.html)
    - custom fonts (lines 37-50, 238 in ./static/styles/main.scss)
    - psuedo elements (lines 473-481, ./static/styles/main.scss)
    - transitions/transforms 
      (anything using the mixins on lines 52-83 of ./static/styles/main.scss)
    - CSS preprocessing (SASS was used for all CSS)
    - mobile layout (anything using mixin on lines 31-35 of ./static/styles/main.scss)
    - fluid layout (percentages used to properly scale at different resolutions)
       - example: line 320, ./static/styles/main.scss

5. DOM manipulation, 6. jQuery
  - Both heavily used hand-in-hand. 
  - Examples:
    - cloning DOM elements to act as fake drag-and-drop ghost image on mobiles
      - lines 138-146, ./static/scripts/LibraryManager.js
    - creating DOM elements to act as loader overlay during saving
      - lines 618-619, 646-654, ./static/scripts/EditorManager.js

9. AJAX Client
  -

10. AJAX Server

11. node.js
  -

14. Server side databases (MongoDB)

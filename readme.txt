=======================


// fixed issues //
- obstacles & scoring sometimes continue moving when answering question
- game continues after displaying game over screen (may be same issue as above)
- after answering once, can still answer while waiting for question to disappear
- gas meter doesn't start at full (visually)
- width of coins too narrow
- on phones, feedback highlight is too strong
- on phones, right answer gains too much gas (may be same issue as above)
- on phones, can click on crossed-out answer

// sorta still need to consider //

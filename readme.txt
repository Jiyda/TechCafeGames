Collaboration Notes:
- We worked with the 15-239 group that developed a nice interface for teachers to input educational multiple choice questions to a database
Their site is at:
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~239/projects/techcafe-games/
This database can be down sometimes, so if it crashes, that is probably why.

A game creation framework to create minigames which are populated with
educational questions intended to teach English.

(Created in the course 15-237: Cross Platform Mobile Web Apps at
 Carnegie Mellon University)

Operation notes:
- to see this application in action, go to 
  edugamify.herokuapp.com
- to run the application locally,
  run "node app" from the top level termproject directory
  then view the application by visiting localhost:8000 

Collaboration Notes:
- We worked with the 15-239 group that developed a nice interface for teachers to input educational multiple choice questions to a database
Their site is at:
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~239/projects/techcafe-games/
This database can be down sometimes, so if it crashes, that is probably why.

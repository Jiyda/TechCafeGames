USER STUDY #1:
  * cues to use arrow keys/clicking
  * words at bottom in circles themselves
  * indication that game has completed
    - generally, more transitions between states
  * different color for +
  * fix jumping
  * preview mode where it's clear that you're just previewing

USER STUDY #2 (Arjun):
  * can constantly win/lose when origin is surrounded with fire
  * change original to avatar when user toggles keys/mouse
  * shouldn't be able to place items over others (especially answers) in editor

USER STUDY #3 (Jie):
  * drag off screen to delete
  * single words associated with pictures
  * make goal balls targets (maybe flashing animations)
  * wasd also works
    - and prompt right when game starts/whenever user pushes mouse to use
      arrows
  * sprite reflects direction.
    - also, maybe give sprite idle animation to initially draw attention

Meeting with Tomer:
  * better relation between balls and answers
    - highlight at start (in series?)
  * add force blocks?
  * for tomorrow:
    - report of feedback we've gotten
    - comparison (with screenshots) showing changes before and after feedback

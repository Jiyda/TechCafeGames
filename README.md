The TechCaFE Teacher Portal is a site where teachers can manage questions and content sets that can then be used in educational games for their class. It is built with Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap, with a Postgres database. The teachers can register and then login, and there is an admin account for admin login. The teacher or admin can then create, manage, and delete questions and content sets.

User Studies


Each of the categories below have a problem brought up by one or more
  users, and our solution that we'll implement for the final product.


Element Purposes
  Problem:
    Users were confused about what each element does when playing and editing.
  Solution:
    Players will be required to play 10 "tutorial" levels when they first start using Edugamify. These levels will display what each object does in an intuitive way.

Controls
  Problem:
    Users didn't know what the controls were when starting a game.
  Solution:
    At the start of each game, an overlay will appear for a second that shows either the arrow keys or a finger/mouse tapping to show the controls of the minigame.

Physics
  Problem:
    Users couldn't move in some spots and things collided in unexpected ways.
  Solution:
    We will fix the gravity and collisions so that it is more intuitive.

Minigame Feedback
  Problem:
    Users were jarred by the sudden jump to the homepage after colliding with the correct answer circle.
  Solution:
    A brief feedback screen will be added after each minigame saying "Correct!" and brief stats about their play so far.

Overwhelming Editor
  Problem:
    Users were unsure what to do in the editor at first, most likely from all the buttons and the blank slate.
  Solution:
    We think that after some more gameplay than our first user tests were exposed to (only one 5 second minigame) then players will be more ready to use the editor.  We don't want to make the editor too simple such that creativity is limited.

Mobile Scaling
  Problem:
    The app is not mobile-friendly to the point of being unusable.
  Solution:
    We will work on CSS scaling to device screens and add a directional pad to use directional controls when on a mobile device.

Save Mechanics
  Problem: 
    Save game makes a new file every time.
  Solution:
    We will overwrite the same file when you open a game to edit it and then save it.
